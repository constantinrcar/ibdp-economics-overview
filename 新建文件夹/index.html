    <section id="market-demand">
        <h2>Market Demand</h2>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Market demand refers to the total quantity of a good or service that all consumers in the market are willing and able to purchase at various price levels.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Points:</strong> Market demand curve is derived by horizontally summing individual demand curves. Price and non-price factors influence market demand.</p>
        <p><strong>Common Mistakes:</strong> Confusing market demand with individual demand.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="income-effect">
        <h2>Income Effect (HL)</h2>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Income effect refers to the change in the quantity demanded of a good when a change in price affects consumer's real purchasing power.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Points:</strong> Price drop increases real income and demand for normal goods but might decrease demand for inferior goods.</p>
        <p><strong>Common Mistakes:</strong> Confusing income effect with price effect.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="real-income">
        <h2>Real Income</h2>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Real income refers to the purchasing power of a consumer's nominal income after adjusting for price changes.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Points:</strong> Real income is impacted by inflation. Higher prices lower real income, reducing purchasing power.</p>
        <p><strong>Common Mistakes:</strong> Confusing nominal income with real income.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="substitution-effect">
        <h2>Substitution Effect (HL)</h2>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Substitution effect refers to the tendency of consumers to switch to cheaper alternatives as the price of a good increases.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Points:</strong> Price changes influence consumer choices between substitutes, and the effect is stronger when more substitutes are available.</p>
        <p><strong>Common Mistakes:</strong> Mixing substitution effect with income effect.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="marginal-utility">
        <h2>Marginal Utility (HL)</h2>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Marginal utility refers to the additional satisfaction or utility gained from consuming one more unit of a good or service.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Points:</strong> Marginal utility typically decreases as more units are consumed, explaining why demand curves slope downward.</p>
        <p><strong>Common Mistakes:</strong> Confusing marginal utility with total utility.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="diminishing-marginal-utility">
        <h2>Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility (HL)</h2>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The law states that as a person consumes more units of a good, the additional utility gained from each extra unit decreases.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Points:</strong> Explains downward-sloping demand curves. As more of a good is consumed, willingness to pay decreases.</p>
        <p><strong>Common Mistakes:</strong> Thinking that diminishing marginal utility leads to decreasing total utility, which is not necessarily true.</p>
